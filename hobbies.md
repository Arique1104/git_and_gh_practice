# Arique Hobbies

## Aviary Pets
_The thing I love about birds is that they have personalities, they have beautiful feathers, and depending on what kind of bird you have, they have certain predictable expectations of care.  Plus, I'm not allergic to them so that's always a plus!_
### Cockatiels
- They can live 35 years
- I have two Cockatiels named Luna and Sunny
- Their favorite snack is millet
- I love giving them showers and then blow drying their feathers dry.  This way my babies don't get cold.

### Chickens
- The main purpose of the chickens I own is so that they lay eggs.
- Taking care of these 5 chickens has been an amazing process for Wilmer and me.
- We've raised them since they were chicks.
- We have thoroughly failed to give them actual names (they really look alike!)
- And we constantly tease my son that we're going to eat one of the chickens.
- But the truth is, it's such a blessing to be able to walk out into our back yard and have breakfast ready and fresh from chickens we have relationships with.  From chickens we raised.

## Essential Oils
- Mixing essential oils, really helps ease my mood and help me focus and meditate.
- I love finding new scents that become my "themes for the moon phase."
- It helps me be more present to a particular lesson that I am focusing on bringing into my life.  
- I go in and out of levels of intensity for this process.  It can be as intense as candles and tarot cards and tagged to the phasing of the moon, or it can be as simple as, "I like this, I think I'm going to keep sniffing it."


## Prayer Beads
- I love finding very specific beads, researching their meanings, and stringing them together to make beautiful jewelry that lays heavy on my neck.
- I find that it's okay when my beads fall apart. (Sometimes because of the heaviness, other times because I think the energies protected me from negative spiritual energy.)
